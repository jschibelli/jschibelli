## üí´ About Me

I‚Äôm a Senior Front-End Engineer with 15+ years of experience building scalable, high-performance web applications.
My focus is on **accessible, maintainable, and automation-ready interfaces** built with React, Next.js, and TypeScript.

I design front-end systems that perform under pressure and scale smoothly‚Äîfrom component structure and CI/CD pipelines to end-to-end testing with Playwright.
I care about developer experience as much as user experience: clean processes, predictable builds, and friction-free releases.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How I Build

* CI/CD pipelines with **GitHub Actions** and **Vercel**
* Automated testing with **Playwright** and **Jest**
* Monorepo management with **Turborepo**
* AI-assisted development using **Cursor**, **Copilot**, and **Windsurf** to standardize repetitive work and accelerate delivery
* Modern accessibility and performance tuning practices (Lighthouse / Core Web Vitals)
